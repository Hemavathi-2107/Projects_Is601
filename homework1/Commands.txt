Commands:

1. ls command : 
    The `ls` command lists files and directories in Unix/Linux and macOS. Common options include `ls -l` (detailed view), `ls -a` (show hidden files), and `ls -R` (recursive listing). In Windows, use `dir` in CMD or `Get-ChildItem` in PowerShell as alternatives. It helps navigate and manage files efficiently in the terminal. ðŸš€
