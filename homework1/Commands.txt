Commands:

1. ls :
      Lists the files and directories in the current directory. Use with options like -l for detailed information or -a to include hidden files.
Example: ls -l
2.cd :
      Changes the current directory to the specified path. It's used to navigate between directories.
Example: cd /home/use    

3.pwd :
       Prints the current working directory, showing the full path of where you are in the filesystem.
Example: pwd

4.cp
Copies files or directories from one location to another. Use -r for recursive copying of directories.
Example: cp file1.txt /path/to/destination

5.rm
Removes files or directories. Be cautious with -r for recursive removal and -f for forced removal, as this deletes content permanently.
Example: rm file1.txt
